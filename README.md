# Deloyn

SSH Publish & Deploy CLI

deloyn is a simple command-line tool to publish and deploy your project via SSH and SFTP under Node.

## Features

- **Interactive confirmation before deployment**  
  Before starting the publishing process, the user is prompted for confirmation, ensuring no accidental deployments.

- **Configurable via `deloyn.config.js` or `deloyn.config.ts`**  
  Easily configure deployment settings using JavaScript or TypeScript configuration files. Flexibility to define server details, source, and target directories.

- **Exclude files and directories**  
  Option to exclude specific files or directories from being published, giving you full control over what gets deployed.

- **Adjustable batch size for uploads**  
  Fine-tune the upload process with configurable batch sizes, allowing for optimized performance based on file sizes or network conditions.

- **Spinner feedback for progress**  
  Visual feedback during the publishing process, with a spinner to show that the deployment is in progress. Helps users understand the current state of the operation.

- **TypeScript support with ESM**  
  Full TypeScript support with ES modules (ESM), ensuring a smooth development experience with type safety and modern JavaScript features.

- **SSH-based deployment**  
  Securely deploy files over SSH to remote servers. The tool supports password authentication or SSH key-based authentication for a secure connection.

- **Real-time error reporting**  
  If any issues occur during the deployment, users receive immediate feedback with detailed error messages to aid troubleshooting.

- **Automated update checks**  
  The CLI automatically checks for new updates to ensure you're always using the latest features and security patches, with the option to update directly from the terminal.

- **Environment-specific configurations**  
  Define different configuration files for various environments (e.g., `config.production.js`, `config.staging.js`) to streamline deployments across multiple environments.

- **Customizable deployment steps**  
  Add custom commands or deployment steps before or after publishing (e.g., running tests, pre-deployment scripts), providing flexibility in the deployment workflow.

- **Log file generation**  
  Logs are generated during deployment, helping you keep track of what was deployed, any issues that arose, and a record of the process for auditing purposes.

- **Support for multiple servers**  
  Deploy to multiple remote servers at once with configurable server details in the config file. This is useful for scaling applications or deploying to different staging environments.

- **Automatic retries on failure**  
  In case of network interruptions or temporary failures, the CLI automatically retries failed uploads, ensuring reliable deployment even under less-than-ideal conditions.

- **Versioning and changelogs**  
  Track the version of each deployment and generate changelogs automatically based on your commit history or version tags, ensuring transparency and traceability for all deployed changes.

- **Customizable output formatting**  
  Customize the verbosity and format of the CLI output (e.g., silent, verbose, or minimal output) depending on your preference or environment.

- **Support for symbolic links**  
  Deploy symbolic links along with your files, ensuring that file references are preserved as intended in the deployment environment.

- **Security enhancements**  
  Features like automatic key rotation for SSH and encrypted deployment credentials in the configuration file to ensure the security of your deployment pipeline.
